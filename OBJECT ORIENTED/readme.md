## Introduction to the Object Oriented Programming Challenges

At its core, software development solves a problem or achieves a result with computation. The software development process first defines a problem, then presents a solution. OOP is one of several major approaches to the software development process.

#### As its name implies, OOP organizes code into object definitions. These are sometimes called classes, and they group together data with related behavior. The data is an object's properties, and the behavior (or functions) are methods.

In other programming languages like Java or C#, you need a class to create an object of it. In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity because there is no class in JavaScript. In JS, an object can be created in two ways: object literal or object constructor.

The object structure makes it flexible within a program. Objects can transfer information by calling and passing data to another object's methods. Also, new classes can receive, or inherit, all the features from a base or parent class. This helps to reduce repeated code.

Your choice of programming approach depends on a few factors. These include the type of problem, as well as how you want to structure your data and algorithms. This section covers OOP principles in JavaScript.
